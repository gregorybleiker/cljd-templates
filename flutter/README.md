# clojuredart/cli

*Warning: non-functional, don't use*

A deps.edn template to generate a clojuredart cli app

## Prerequisites

Will only work with clojure > 1.12. Might work with earlier versions, but you have to figure out how yourself.

## Usage

This is a template project for use with [deps-new](https://github.com/seancorfield/deps-new).

Assuming you have installed `deps-new` as your `new` "tool" via:

```bash
clojure -Ttools install-latest :lib io.github.seancorfield/deps-new :as new
```

With this repo cloned, you can `cd` into the cloned directory and run:

    $ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {net.clojars.clojuredart/cli {:local/root "."}}}' -Tnew create :template clojuredart/cli :name myusername/mycoollib

Without cloning, you can run

    $ clojure -Tnew create :template com.github.gregorybleiker/cljd-templates%clojuredart/cli :name myusername/mycoollib

Sample invocations are in `run.sh` and `run_git.sh`


Run this template project's tests (by default, this just validates your template's `template.edn`
file -- that it is valid EDN and it satisfies the `deps-new` Spec for template files):

    $ clojure -T:build test
